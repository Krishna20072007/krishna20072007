Hi! Iâ€™m Krishna, a first-year CSE student with a soft spot for math, a passion for tech, and a mind thatâ€™s always bouncing between algorithms and melodies.
When Iâ€™m not solving problems (or trying to), youâ€™ll find me composing music or dominating the battlefield in Call of Duty: Mobile. Yepâ€”I'm a professional CODM player too. Balance? More like controlled chaos. ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ®ðŸ’»
Iâ€™m on a mission to combine logic with creativityâ€”whether itâ€™s in code, rhythm, or strategy.
